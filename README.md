# Student Enrollment Form – Micro Project

## 📄 Description

This is a web-based Student Enrollment Form developed as part of a micro project. It allows the user to **add**, **update**, and **reset** student records using **JsonPowerDB (JPDB)** as the backend database.

Operations are driven by the primary key `Roll No.` to check for existing data and perform appropriate database actions (Insert/Update).
